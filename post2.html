    <p>Client: Therapy For Us By Us
      Role: UX Designer

      Timeline: 1 month

    </p>
    <br />

    <h5>The Problem:</h5>
    <p>Black people face several challenges in accessing mental health care, including the persistent lack of Black
      therapists. This is partially due to cultural stigma and other issues within their community that make it
      difficult for them to receive help.
    </p>
    <h3>Background</h3>
    <h5>
      Hypothesis:</h5>
    <p>A website that is culturally relevant and connects with Black people seeking mental health assistance. The site
      also ensures their safety by providing a reference point to combat stigmas, doubts, or fears of being alone during
      this process. A contact form that will connect the user's to a Black therapist from within the comfort of your own
      home.
    </p>

    <h5>The Why:</h5>
    <p>The adult Black community in America is 20% more likely than the general population to experience serious mental
      health problems. Only one-third of Black Americans who need help receive it. To give a comparison: About 25% of
      Blacks seek mental care compared to 40% of whites.
    </p>

    <h5>
      Buisness ​Oppurtunties:</h5>
    <p>Provide a safe space where Black people can get informed on trauma and PTSD. As well as generate more leads in
      getting Black clients who seek mental health assistance in trauma and PTSD. Share articles and content that
      informs and encourages mental wellness.
    </p>

    <h3>Research</h3>

    <h5>Competitive Analysis:</h5>
    <p>Through competitive analysis, I found that many Black therapist websites are directory-based. They aren't many
      trauma-targeted black therapists. The more specific the search for mental health therapy, the less diverse the
      therapist was.

    <h5>Interview Questions:</h5>

      <br>
      <li>- What are 3 things that you are looking for from a therapist? </li>
      <br>

      <li>- Where do you go to get informed on mental health treatments and practices? </li>

    </ul>

    <h5>Interview Results:</h5>
    <p> Interview Results
      I interviewed 7 Black participants between the ages of 22-37 who are considering seeing a therapist.
    </p>

    <h3>Insight</h3>
    <h5>Pain Points:</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>- Few of the participants didn't have a trusted source they could get help regarding their mental health.
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>- Hard to find the confidence to get the help they may need. </li>
      <br>
      <li>- A participant claimed that therapist directories lack personality and made it difficult to find a therapist
        they can identify with.</li>
      <br>
      <li>- Many participants were concerned about the stigma attached to mental health.</li>
    </ul>

    </ul>

    <h3>Concept</h3>
    <h5>Key Design:</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>- Onboarding will allow the app to collect user's outdoor interests. </li>
      <br>
      <li>- A tailored profile page that shows neighboring parks and activities happening around the user. As well as
        other parks throughout the city that matches the user's interests. </li>
      <br>
      <li>- User-friendly search field to find a park or facility with a zip code or borough.</li>
      <br>
      <li>- Not familiar with New York City parks, besides the ones near their neighborhood. </li>
      <br>
      <li>- An integrated social platform that will allow users to share photos and event filers to connect with fellow
        park goers. </li>
      <br>
    </ul>

    <h5>Testing:</h5>
    <p> Due to the client's time constraint, I was unable to do any testing before launching.
    </p>

    <h5>​Key Learnings:</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>- Based on insight from the qualitative data and the competitive analysis, many therapist websites are cold
        and lack personality. Users say it's hard to identify with someone through a directory. </li>
      <br>
      <li>- I decided to go for a yellow-themed website because of research on color therapy. The color yellow
        represents positivity and hopefulness. </li>
      <br>
      <li>- Self-doubt and fear are common issues that users may deal with as they search for aid. I added a
        self-analysis test to help users comfortably seek help in private before they decide to take the next step. ​
      </li>
      <br>
    </ul>

    <h5>​Value:</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>- Increased consultation leads by 10 percent over a course of a month. </li>
      <br>
      <li>- Users expressed gratitude for welcoming content that understood their fears. They felt seen and safe. </li>
      <br>
    </ul>
