    <h3>Duende</h3>

    <p>Project Name: Duende 3D
      Role: Creator and Designer

      Timeline: 2 years
    </p>
    <br />

    <h5>The Problem:</h5>
    <p>In a world where art is everywhere, from the design of your coffee table to illustrations of your favorite
      cartoons yet art history and maintaining the interest in fine arts can be very difficult to get young kids on
      board. As an artist and an art enthusiast, I found it very hard to convince my nieces and nephews to come with me
      to a museum. I noticed that museums and galleys didn't provide much work directed to a younger audience.
    </p>
    <h3>Background</h3>
    <h5>
      Hypothesis:</h5>
    <p>Create a collection of work that connects with both children and adults. A product that encourages all ages to
      explore the fine arts world without feeling intimidated; but is fun and meaningful.
    </p>

    <h5>The Why:</h5>
    <p>Encourage art and culture to a younger audience in an engaging way.
    </p>

    <h5>
      Buisness ​Oppurtunties:</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>- Create an engaging art collection that encourages younger arti</li>
      <br>
      <li>- Create a product that is a household name in the art world. </li>
      <br>
      <li>- Create an immersive experience that is unique that can convert more people into the arts. </li>
      <br>
    </ul>

    <h3>Research</h3>

    <h5>Field Research:</h5>
    <p>I conducted a series of art workshops and group field trips to museums and galleries to observe the user's
      interactions with fine art.
    </p>

    <h5>Research Results:</h5>
    <p> I spent two years working with children in the field of art. From my research, I've found that children are more
      engaged in the work when technology is present in the viewing experience. Immersive art is something that keeps
      them interested and excited in the process.
    </p>

    <h3>Insight</h3>
    <h5>Pain Points:</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>- Easily lose interest.
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>- Not able to touch art work or be interactive. </li>
      <br>
      <li>-
        Pain Points
        Easily lose interest
        Hard to comprehend fine art.</li>
      <br>
      <li>- Lack of storytelling in fine art spaces for users to understand.</li>
      <br>
      <li>- Lack of fine art directed to children.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Concept</h3>
    <h5>Key Design:</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>- I converted my canvas paintings to digital formate. </li>
      <br>
      <li>- I added 3d technology to the digital images to enhance the viewing experience. </li>
      <br>
      <li>- wrote an engaging and captivating story to keep their attention.</li>
      <br>
    </ul>

    </div>

    <h5>Testing:</h5>
    <p> I conducted a usability test with the prototype book. I had four kids ages 5-7 read along with the story and
      observed their level of engagement. Many were very intrigued and delighted by the book. They also shared their
      discomfort with the words not being fully 3d which, made it hard to read along.

    <h5>​Key Learnings:</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>- Through research and constant iteration I designed the 1st ever 3D art book for children and adults alike.
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>- My two years working with children and observing how they interact with art lead me to create an immersive
        storybook that encourages readers to continue on their magical journey of life. </li>
      <br>
      <li>- After the useability tests, I uncovered that making the images just 3d and not the words made it hard to
        read and enjoy the book. I changed the page color and font so they can be legible with the 3d chroma-depth
        glasses. I also changed the typography for a bolder look and; have the layout follow a whimsical flow to keep
        engagement. ​
      </li>
      <br>
    </ul>

    <h5>​Value:</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>- Sold 500 Books. (Sold out collection)</li>
      <br>
      <li>-Increased in the interest of art and contemporary artist. </li>
